### Why React?
This is a project I decided to make after taking Udemy's React course to solidify my understanding. React is also a popular framework which is widely used, hence why I decided to pick up on it. I decided to use Tailwind CSS since I find it more intuitive (just adding small classes) and help me learn which attributes is used often.

### How to run the project?
Download the project and open the folder in your prefered IDE. In the terminal type "install npm". After that's finished, type "npm run dev" and local server should appear. Click on the link to the local server and enjoy!

The turn alternates between 2 players, red and blue. Each player can click a line to claim it. The player to press the line that completes the box will capture that box and can continue on with their turn. There are 36 boxes. Once all the lines are claimed, the player who has the most boxes win.
